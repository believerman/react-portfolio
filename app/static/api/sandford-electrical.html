<p>A responsive website for an electrical contractor. <em>(Note: this site is awaiting final sign-off, and has not yet been launched.)</em></p>
<p>I was responsible for progressing the project from flat design files to a fully-functional and responsive site. The designer provided several Illustrator mockups of the desktop design - one for each of the major pages - and asked me to use them as design direction for smaller screen sizes.</p>

<p>For this site, we decided to use the <a href="https://siteorigin.com/theme/vantage/" target="_blank">Vantage</a> theme by SiteOrigin. After creating a child theme and adding some of the content to the homepage, my first step was to use the theme's in-built customisation settings to recreate the design as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Some of the design features were not possible to achieve using the standard options built into the theme, so I completely replaced the default header with a custom one, and added a lot of custom CSS.</p>
<p><img src="/images/projects/sandford-electrical-about.jpg" alt="" class="left" /></p>
<p>This allowed me to get the design details for the header exactly right, creating a much more consistent, useable, and aesthetically pleasing menu across all screen sizes, including an animation to streamline the menu when scrolled on larger screens and a convenient mobile menu fixed to the bottom of smaller screens.</p>
