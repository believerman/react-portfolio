<p>A responsive website for a cancer research trust.</p>
<p>I was responsible for designing and developing the site based on the company logo and some draft content. The client wanted the site to portray a clean and professional aesthetic, and it was important for it to be easy to navigate. In particular, it was essential that potential donors would be able to contribute with as little hassle as possible.</p>

<p>Because I like to design in the browser, the first step I took was to add the content to a WordPress install. I ensured that it followed a clear content hierarchy so that it was easy to digest, and then began to customise the theme. I used the <a href="https://avada.theme-fusion.com/" target="_blank">Avada</a> theme, which delivers a huge number of important features out of the box, and tried to keep as closely to the built-in functionality as possible in order to aid performance.</p>
<p>I progressed the site to a point where it felt close to the intended aesthetic, and then added the final touches with hand-coded CSS. This smoothed out some of the rough edges of the site, and resulted in the clean and professional look which the client wanted.</p>

<p>For the homepage, I decided to aid usability by taking an unusual approach. Instead of building a typical page with an amalgamation of content from the rest of the site, I built a simple and clear full-page menu which presents the available options to the user graphically.</p>
<p>To make sure the experience was optimal on all devices, I used a combination of the flex box model and the calc unit functions to dynamically resize all six main options plus the donate button to fill the available space. The result is an intuitive landing page which retains the same feel as the rest of the site.</p>
