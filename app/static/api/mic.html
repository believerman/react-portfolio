<p>A simple, responsive portfolio for an interior fit-out contractor.</p>
<p>I was responsible for progressing the project from flat design files to a fully-functional and responsive site. The designer provided an Illustrator mockups of the desktop design of the single-page site, and asked me to use it as design direction for smaller screen sizes.</p>

<p>I followed the standard procedures I have developed for the creation of a DNN site. The base for the skin was a custom-made template with as little structure as possible. I hand-built the layout to match the content structure inherent in the designs, entered any content that had been provided, and then wrote the CSS in-browser. This approach gives both a high degree of control and a lot of flexibility, which allows me to quickly advance the build of the site to match the design.</p>

<p>I also created a custom jQuery script for the portfolio section. The client wanted a very rigid and controlled look and feel for the site, to reflect the ethos of the company, and the portfolio was a key part of this.</p>
