<p>A responsive website for Symatrix, an Oracle Platinum Partner.</p>
<p>I was responsible for progressing the project from flat design files to a fully-functional and responsive site. The designer provided several Illustrator mockups of the desktop design - one for each of the major pages - and asked me to use them as design direction for smaller screen sizes.</p>

<p>For this site we used a starter theme I had created, based on the <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">underscores</a> starter theme, in conjunction with the <a href="https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/" target="_blank">SiteOrigin Page Builder</a>. As usual, the first step I took was to add the content to the site, and then began to customise the theme.</p>
<p>I started by creating the most basic page on the site - the <a href="http://www.symatrix.com/careers/" target="_blank">Careers page</a> - in order to focus on the simplest elements of the theme. Most importantly, the design included a full-screen menu with custom animations, which was achieved via CSS and a simple jQuery toggle script.</p>
<p>Next, I created the <a href="http://www.symatrix.com/" target="_blank">Home page</a> (above), which included two pieces of custom functionality: the cloud in the banner, and the side-scrolling section titled "The Answers". In both cases, I started off by structuring the content in a logical order, and then used CSS and jQuery to create the script by hand.</p>

<p>The other important functionality was used on the <a href="http://www.symatrix.com/about-us/" target="_blank">About Us</a> and <a href="http://www.symatrix.com/services/" target="_blank">Services</a> pages. The client wanted to include a lot of content on these pages, organised into sub-sections, and the design specified a clean and simple side-menu. I created a script which would build the side-menu dynamically based on the content added into the Page Builder, ensuring the client would be able to easily add or remove sections in the future. The script also handles any interactions to control which of the sub-pages appear.</p>
