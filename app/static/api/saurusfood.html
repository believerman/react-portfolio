<p>A responsive recipe blog using the WordPress platform.</p>
<p>I worked closely with the client to develop a quirky and fun identity for their blog. The client created a varied set of illustrations, and from there I designed and developed the site to fit the clean but whimsical style desired.</p>

<p>As one of the main goals of the site was for it to be as clean and simple as possible, I used the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/blankslate/">BlankSlate</a> theme as a base, which provides as much development freedom as possible. I kept the markup structure simple and logical while allowing for design flair to be added via CSS.</p>
<p>The recipes were added using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ultimate-recipe/">WP Ultimate Recipe</a> plugin, which provides the ideal functionality for a recipe blog.</p>

<p>The site was built using a mobile-first philosophy, which ensures that it looks good and functions well on all devices. </p>
