    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Untitled Designing Limited <span>Oct 2009 - present</span></h4>
    <h5>Lead Web Developer</h5>
    <p>In my current position I am responsible for the creation and development of client websites, including back-end development, but with a focus on front-end.</p>
    <p>I am responsible for organising my workload and prioritising tasks, and am accustomed to maintaining high standards while managing multiple projects with demanding deadlines.</p>
    <p>Most of the sites are created using the DotNetNuke and WordPress platforms, although a small number are flat HTML. Projects range from adding functionality - such as responsiveness - through to full site development.</p>
    <p>My key tasks include installation, content propagation, skinning/theming, testing, launching, technical monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance.</p>
    <p>Other responsibilities include streamlining the company's processes, identifying and implementing best practice procedures in all areas of work, participating in design direction sessions, guiding the technical and professional development of other employees, and occasional copywriting and editing.</p>
    <h4>Way of the Warrior<br /> & Midnight Sun <span>Aug 2013 - Apr 2015</span></h4>
    <h5>Online Game Developer</h5>
    <p>As an exercise to expand our knowledge and skill sets, my partner and I created two online games. The projects allowed me to indulge in some ui/ux design and complex back-end development free of outside constraints, gain an in-depth understanding of PHP/MySQL development, and become much more proficient with the use of AJAX/jQuery to create responsive real-time applications.</p>
    <h4>Zynga <span>Jul 2008 - Aug 2008</span></h4>
    <h5>Graphic Design Work Experience</h5>
    <p>I gained some work experience as part of a team creating Facebook game applications. I was responsible for the creation of various assets, particularly in-game graphics and advertising banners. I also contributed to discussions relating to the game structure and functionality.</p>
