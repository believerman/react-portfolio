<p>A simple, responsive website for an award-winning Cheshire country pub.</p>
<p>I was responsible for progressing the project from flat design files to a fully-functional and responsive site. The designer provided several Illustrator mockups of the desktop design - one for each of the major pages - and a single mockup of the mobile version of the homepage.</p>

<p>I followed the standard procedures I have developed for the creation of a DNN site. The base for the skin was a custom-made template with as little structure as possible. I hand-built the layout to match the content structure inherent in the designs, entered any content that had been provided, and then wrote the CSS in-browser. This approach gives both a high degree of control and a lot of flexibility, which allows me to quickly advance the build of the site to match the design.</p>
<p>I also created a simple jQuery script for the banner slider. Compared to similar DNN plugins this script is extremely lightweight, and it allowed for the content to adjust more intelligently for different screen sizes.</p>
