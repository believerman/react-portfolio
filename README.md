# A portfolio powered by React.

[View live site](http://www.jmcgrath.co.uk) or [view site repo](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/jtmcgrath.github.io).

My portfolio was originally made using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, but it felt like time to rebuild it using some more modern tech. Pretty much all the tech I used to make it was new to me, so any comments or suggestions would be more than welcome.

Built using React, ES6, SASS, Axios, react-router, Babel, and Webpack.
